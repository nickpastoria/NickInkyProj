"Well, it sounds like a bit of a cookie mystery! I can't really say for sure since I wasn't there and I don't know your dad's habits. But, I can suggest a fun way to figure it out! Next time you have a cookie, maybe you could leave a tiny note near it saying, "Please don't eat this, it's my special cookie!" If your cookie still disappears, then it might be time to play detective and look for cookie crumbs! But remember, it's always important to communicate. You could also just ask your dad if he saw or ate the cookie. ðŸ˜Š"
Drats! Thats a good idea... for next time. But I still need to find the answer now.

Ahh. Sorry bud. I'm actually super busy, and don't have a taste for cookies today.

You yell! "You! YOU! I know it was you who took my cookie!"
Dad looks at you with a shocked expression on his face.
"I'm sorry kiddo," he pleas. "I was really hungry this morning and I needed to grab something before I went to work."
You stare at him! "I KNEW IT! I knew it because Maddy ran right up to you when I told her to track the scent of cinnamon!"
"Oh gosh, chum, you're  too smart for your own good. I did plan on making it up to you though!"
"That's why I bought this whole new box of cookies home from the bakery!
    I love you!"

You leave the conversation for now to go and do your best drawing a wanted poster for your cookie.
The sign says "My Cookie, Wanted! (Alive) 1 Hug Reward"
You hurry back to show the sign to your dad.
"Oh shoot! I'm sorry you lost your cookie. Could I get that hug anyway?"
* sure
    You give your dad a hug, and he hugs you back
    ->DadRestart
* no
    You shake your head and say! No I need to find my cookie first!
    ->DadRestart

You stare at dad directly in the eyes. Unflinching.
Dad breaks the silence.
"Is something wrong bud? You seem upset"
